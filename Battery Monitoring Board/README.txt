If all the CAD components can't be found in the 3D view is because some parts are referenced to a local folder
in another system. They can be downladed from the "KiCAD Libraries" repository found in Sabin's CADLAB.io account.
There is a link to such account in the team's GitHub, inside the "2021 Accumulator Electronics" repository.
